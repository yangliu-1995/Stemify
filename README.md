# Stemify
ðŸŽµ Stemify â€” An open-source iOS app for offline music source separation.  
Built with C++ and TensorFlow Lite, Stemify brings [Spleeter](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter)â€™s vocal/accompaniment separation to iOS.  
Inspired by [jinay1991/spleeter](https://github.com/jinay1991/spleeter), it adopts a sliding-window approach to handle limited mobile memory, making high-quality separation possible on iOS devices.
